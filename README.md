## Mars-Selfbot
A selfbot tool for discord clients.

### How to get your Token

## Option 1
  This works best on a ***personal server***
    - Go into the Discord browser version and press Ctrl+Shift+I then press Ctrl+R in the prompt that just opened and type in the search bar ***messages***
    - Look for ***Authority*** or ***Authorization*** and copy the value (That value is your Token) this will be used later.

### Pre-Startup
- Go into the file and look for ``Token = ""`` put your token in between the ``""``

### Startup
After you have put the Token in you can start the python file by either using your IDE's terminal or your OS' terminal

- In your IDE just click your start button (if you have one)

- In your OS' terminal just do python ***file-location*** (should start it up)

### Browser support
I can or cannot confirm browser support for ***Mars-Selfbot*** if anybody would like to test that for me go ahead!


You may need to install ***discord.py*** if so read this below.

### discord.py installation
- Create a dedicated file for Mars-Selfbot
- Open your Terminal and type in ``cd (file's location)`` Windows users will first have to cd into the Desktop location by doing ``cd Desktop`` then run the ``cd (file's location``
- While you are still in the Terminal and type in ``pip install discord`` ***Python will be required***

### Known Issues
No Issues to report (cool)
