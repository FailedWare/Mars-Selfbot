## Mars-Selfbot
A selfbot tool for discord clients.

### Pre-Startup
- Go into the file and look for ``Token = ""`` put your token in between the ``""``

### Startup
- After you have put the Token in you can start the python file by either using your IDE's terminal or your OS' terminal

- In your IDE just click your start button (if you have one)

- In your OS' terminal just do python ***file-location*** (should start it up)

### Browser support
- I can or cannot confirm browser support for ***Mars-Selfbot*** if anybody would like to test that for me go ahead!
